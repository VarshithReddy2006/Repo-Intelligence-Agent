"""Fallback Renderer — Phase 10.

When the LLM is unavailable, renders a clean, professional response using
only the structured intelligence gathered from the repository.

Design principles:
  - NEVER dump hundreds of lines of raw code
  - NEVER expose provider names, API errors, or stack traces
  - ALWAYS show what was found, what's available, and what to try next
  - Structured format matching the Phase 11 answer template
