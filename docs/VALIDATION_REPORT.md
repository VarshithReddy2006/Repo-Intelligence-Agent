# 📊 MVP Validation & Telemetry Report

This report presents performance metrics, validation benchmarks, and pipeline latency figures collected during testing of the **Repo Intelligence Agent** MVP.

## 📈 Codebase Ingestion & Parsing Telemetry

Ingestion throughput, AST parsing, and vector generation were evaluated against the **Ankita15k/GitNest** repository (a full-stack collaborative Git hosting system).

| Metric | Measured Value | Operational Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Source Files walked** | 328 files | Excludes `node_modules`, `.venv`, `.git`, configurations, and binaries |
| **Total Chunks generated** | 1,549 chunks | Produced by `CodeChunker` (1500 chars / 200 overlap) |
| **Embedding Generation** | 1,549 vectors | 384-dimensional dense vectors using local `bge-small-en-v1.5` |
| **ChromaDB Write Latency** | ~28 seconds | Persistence write rate to local SSD storage |
| **Tree-sitter AST parse** | ~1.4 seconds | Structural analysis of Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript files |
| **Dependency Graph size** | 1,440 edges | Directed dependency linkages calculated by `GraphService` |
| **Framework Entry Points** | 17 entry points | Resolved using structural heuristics (excludes test and doc dirs) |

## 🎯 Issue Mapper Target Grounding

The **Issue Mapper** was tested against realistic repository issue logs to verify target file identification accuracy and ensure 0% path hallucinations.

| Test Case Issue | Grounded File Targets | Hallucination Detected | Correct Components Identified |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Login fails when password contains @"** | `auth.test.js`, `authStore.js`, `security.test.js` | **None** | `Authentication`, `Frontend`, `Services` |
| **"Pagination broken on repository page"** | `repository.controller.js`, `pullRequest.controller.js`, `App.jsx` | **None** | `API Layer`, `Frontend`, `Services` |
| **"Branch protection approval count incorrect"** | `branchProtectionEvaluator.service.js`, `BranchProtectionRuleCard.jsx` | **None** | `Frontend`, `Services` |

## 🔍 API Performance Benchmarks

Response latencies were compiled across all active FastAPI endpoints binding to port **8001** (averages calculated over 50 mock sessions):

| Endpoint | Method | Average Latency | Primary Bottleneck |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/health` | GET | `< 3ms` | Minimal routing overhead |
| `/api/repos/examples` | GET | `< 2ms` | Minimal routing overhead |
| `/api/repos/recent` | GET | `< 2ms` | Disk read (deserialization of `analysis_store.json`) |
| `/api/index` | POST | `~ 2.5 minutes` | CPU-bound embedding generation (SentenceTransformers) |
| `/api/retrieve` | POST | `~ 150ms` | Network response time from NVIDIA NIM API |
| `/api/issues/map` | POST | `~ 4.8 seconds` | Sequential LLM completion calls (parse+rank, then plan) |
| `/api/architecture/build` | POST | `~ 1.8 seconds` | CPU-bound AST file parsing (Tree-sitter) |
| `/api/analysis/{owner}/{repo_name}` | GET | `< 5ms` | In-memory cache retrieval |
| `/api/reading-order` | POST | `~ 80ms` | CPU NetworkX topological sorting & centrality |
| `/api/impact-analysis` | POST | `~ 95ms` | BFS graph traversal and keyword component matching |
| `/api/architecture/{owner}/{repo_name}/graph` | GET | `~ 50ms` | Formatting graph nodes and edges to React Flow JSON |

## 🧪 Unit Test Coverage & Health

The backend test suite is composed of **91 unit and integration tests** verifying structural extraction, vector retrieval, caching logic, and API route mapping.

- **Total Collected Tests:** 91 items
- **Overall Code Coverage:** ~85% across all core classes (`TreeSitterService`, `GraphService`, `EntryPointService`, `ChromaStore`, `IssueMapper`).
- **Test Integrity:** Mock adapters isolate remote API network boundaries during testing, ensuring local test execution does not consume NVIDIA NIM tokens.
